bugfixes for evaluator:
in disco_transform_search.py:
insert in line 230:
    res = [r for r in res if r[2] or r[0] not in children_nodes]
    # bugfix. Should not include children if add_and_move since children need to be detached later

change line 399:
    if change < -1 and (best is not None or value != None):
        # Bugfix: for first iteration: cannot continue since that would leave best = None
        continue
